<h1> PRROJECT DESCRIPTION </h1>
<h2> This project is to design an automated sorting sytem for a conveyor belt in a smart
warehouse. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of objects moving on
the conveyor belt and a servo motor to adjust the position of a deflector arm based on the
distance. The ultrasonic sensor is uded to measure the distance
of the objects and control the servo motor to move the deflector arm accordingly. The program will continuously monitor the distance and adjusts the arm in real-time.</h2>
